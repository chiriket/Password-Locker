#### By Shirley Keter

## Description
The application allows users with multiple accounts to store their credentials.They can then access their details search as their account usernames and passwords through their application.The application also allows users to create new credentials for different accounts.

## Application Specifications
A user first runs the application on the terminal using the command: python3.6 run.py
They will receive a welcome message asking for their name.
After the name they will be directed to a section where they need to choose whether they want to create an account, login or exit the application.
depending on what they choose they will be directed to a new path.
If they choose to create an account, they will be required to enter the neccesary details to create a new account.
If they selected login, then they will be prompted to enter their username and password which will then be verified to determine if they already have an account. If they do have an account, they proceed to the page where they can create their account credentials.If they do not have an account then they will be required to create a new account.
After successfully creating their accounts/ logging in, users are then able to create credentials for the accounts that they would like to save.
One can view their saved accounts and even has the ability to search for a specific saved account by using the account platform name.
When users are done saving their credentials they can then use a short-code and exit the application.
